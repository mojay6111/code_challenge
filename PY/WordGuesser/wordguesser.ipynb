    "   * \"1\" = correct letter, wrong position\n",
    "   * \"0\" = letter not in the secret word\n",

    "   * **Pass 2**: Assign partial matches (\"1\") from left to right for remaining letters.\n",

    "   if guess_letters[i] is not None and guess_letters[i] in secret_letters:\n",
    "       result[i] = \"1\"\n",

    "   * Remove the matched letter from `secret_letters` to avoid reusing it.\n",

    "4. **Return Result**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return \"\".join(result)\n",
    "   ```\n",
