    "We are asked to calculate a person’s age **as of November 27, 2025**, given their birthdate in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Birthdates are always **valid and before Nov 27, 2025**.\n",
    "2. Age must consider whether the person has **already celebrated their birthday in 2025**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: If someone is born on December 5, 2000, by Nov 27, 2025, they are still **24**, not 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Thinking About the Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the birthdate string into **year, month, day**.\n",
    "2. Compare the birth month/day to the target date (Nov 27, 2025).\n",
    "3. If their birthday hasn’t occurred yet in 2025, subtract 1 from the difference between 2025 and birth year.\n",
    "4. Otherwise, the age is simply `2025 - birth year`.\n",

    "1. **Healthcare systems** – Age determines eligibility for vaccines, screenings, or pediatric vs adult care.\n",
    "2. **Education** – Checking if students meet age requirements for school enrollment or exams.\n",
    "3. **Finance** – Age verification for loans, insurance, retirement planning.\n",
    "4. **Gaming & Social Apps** – Verifying age for age-restricted content or features.\n",
    "5. **Government services** – Driver’s licenses, passports, senior citizen benefits.\n",

    "Basically, any domain where eligibility or personalization depends on **age** can benefit from this calculation.\n"
